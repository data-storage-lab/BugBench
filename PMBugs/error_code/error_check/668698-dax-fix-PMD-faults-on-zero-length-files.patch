Subject: [PATCH 668698/911378] dax: fix PMD faults on zero-length files

PMD faults on a zero length file on a file system mounted with -o dax
will not generate SIGBUS as expected.

	fd = open(...O_TRUNC);
	addr = mmap(NULL, 2*1024*1024, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
	*addr = 'a';
        <expect SIGBUS>

The problem is this code in dax_iomap_pmd_fault:

	max_pgoff = (i_size_read(inode) - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

If the inode size is zero, we end up with a max_pgoff that is way larger
than 0.  :)  Fix it by using DIV_ROUND_UP, as is done elsewhere in the
kernel.

I tested this with some simple test code that ensured that SIGBUS was
received where expected.
