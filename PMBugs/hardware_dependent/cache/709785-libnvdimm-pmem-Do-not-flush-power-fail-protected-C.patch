Subject: [PATCH 709785/911378] libnvdimm, pmem: Do not flush power-fail
 protected CPU caches

This commit:

5fdf8e5ba566 ("libnvdimm: re-enable deep flush for pmem devices via fsync()")

intended to make sure that deep flush was always available even on
platforms which support a power-fail protected CPU cache.  An unintended
side effect of this change was that we also lost the ability to skip
flushing CPU caches on those power-fail protected CPU cache.

Fix this by skipping the low level cache flushing in dax_flush() if we have
CPU caches which are power-fail protected.  The user can still override this
behavior by manually setting the write_cache state of a namespace.  See
libndctl's ndctl_namespace_write_cache_is_enabled(),
ndctl_namespace_enable_write_cache() and
ndctl_namespace_disable_write_cache() functions.
