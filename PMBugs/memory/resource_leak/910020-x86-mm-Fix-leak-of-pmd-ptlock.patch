Subject: [PATCH 910020/911378] x86/mm: Fix leak of pmd ptlock

Commit

  28ee90fe6048 ("x86/mm: implement free pmd/pte page interfaces")

introduced a new location where a pmd was released, but neglected to
run the pmd page destructor. In fact, this happened previously for a
different pmd release path and was fixed by commit:

  c283610e44ec ("x86, mm: do not leak page->ptl for pmd page tables").

This issue was hidden until recently because the failure mode is silent,
but commit:

  b2b29d6d0119 ("mm: account PMD tables like PTE tables")

turns the failure mode into this signature:

Given this is a repeat occurrence it seemed prudent to look for other
places where this destructor might be missing and whether a better
helper is needed. try_to_free_pmd_page() looks like a candidate, but
testing with setting up and tearing down pmd mappings via the dax unit
tests is thus far not triggering the failure.

As for a better helper pmd_free() is close, but it is a messy fit
due to requiring an @mm arg. Also, ___pmd_free_tlb() wants to call
paravirt_tlb_remove_table() instead of free_page(), so open-coded
pgtable_pmd_page_dtor() seems the best way forward for now.

Debugged together with Matthew Wilcox <willy@infradead.org>.
