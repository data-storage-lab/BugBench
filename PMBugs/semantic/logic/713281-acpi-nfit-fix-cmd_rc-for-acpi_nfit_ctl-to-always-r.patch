Subject: [PATCH 713281/911378] acpi/nfit: fix cmd_rc for acpi_nfit_ctl to
 always return a value

cmd_rc is passed in by reference to the acpi_nfit_ctl() function and the
caller expects a value returned. However, when the package is pass through
via the ND_CMD_CALL command, cmd_rc is not touched. Make sure cmd_rc is
always set.

Fixes: aef253382266 ("libnvdimm, nfit: centralize command status translation")
