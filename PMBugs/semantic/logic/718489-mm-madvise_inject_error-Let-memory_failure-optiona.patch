Subject: [PATCH 718489/911378] mm, madvise_inject_error: Let memory_failure()
 optionally take a page reference

The madvise_inject_error() routine uses get_user_pages() to lookup the
pfn and other information for injected error, but it does not release
that pin. The assumption is that failed pages should be taken out of
circulation.

However, for dax mappings it is not possible to take pages out of
circulation since they are 1:1 physically mapped as filesystem blocks,
or device-dax capacity. They also typically represent persistent memory
which has an error clearing capability.

In preparation for adding a special handler for dax mappings, shift the
responsibility of taking the page reference to memory_failure(). I.e.
drop the page reference and do not specify MF_COUNT_INCREASED to
memory_failure().
