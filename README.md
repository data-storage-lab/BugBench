# BugBench<sup>k</sub> </sup>

This repository contains real-world bug cases curated by Data Storage Lab @ISU and studied in our research projects. Depending on the projects, we may perform a variety of analysis on the bug cases including characterization, reproducibility experiments, bug detection, failure diagnosis, etc. We hope that our efforts and the resulting dataset will inspire follow-up research in the communities and help measure and improve system reliability in general.

## Persistent Memory Bugs in the Linux Kernel ##

This folder contains the dataset studied in our paper "A Study of Persistent Memory Bugs in the Linux Kernel", which was published in the Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference ([SYSTOR](https://www.systor.org/2021/index.html)), 2021.

## Benchmarking for Observability ##

This folder contains the dataset studied in our paper "Benchmarking for Observability: The Case of Diagnosing Storage Failures", which was published in BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation ([TBench](https://www.benchcouncil.org/index.html)), 2021.

We used the dataset to measure the debugging observability of two general debugging tools: FTrace and PANDA.

The repository contains two files:
- Manual file: how to run and use each image.
- Link file: due to storage limits, it is unavailable to upload images to current repository. The link shows how to get images.
