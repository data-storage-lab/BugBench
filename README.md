# Bugbench<sup>k</sub> </sup>for Observability

This repository contains info of images and running process of Bugbench<sup>k</sub></sup>.

We have designed a Bugbench<sup>k</sub> </sup>to test two general debugging tools: FTrace and PANDA, and published our results in our paper "[Benchmarking for Reliability: The Case of Diagnosing Storage Failures]". Our paper was published in BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation ([TBench](https://www.benchcouncil.org/journal.html)).

The repository contains two files:
- Manual file: how to run and use each image.
- Link file: due to storage limits, it is unavailable to upload images to current repository. The link shows how to get images.

We hope that our initial efforts and the resulting open-source Bugbench<sup>k</sub> </sup> will inspire follow-up research in the communities and help measure and improve system reliability in general.

Please feel free to direct your concerns or feedback to: Duo Zhang (duozhang@iastate.edu).
